# C++ Web Server using Boost Beast with Test-Driven Development (TDD) - To-Do List

## Overview
In this project, we will create a C++ web server using the Boost Beast library. We'll follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices to ensure the reliability and correctness of our codebase through automated tests.

## To-Do List

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment
- [ ] Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual C++)
- [ ] Install Boost C++ Libraries (if not already installed)
- [ ] Choose a testing framework (e.g., Google Test)

### 2. Create Project Structure
- [ ] Create a new directory for your project
- [ ] Inside the project directory, create subdirectories for source code, headers, tests, and build artifacts

### 3. Write Initial Tests
- [ ] Define a test case for server startup
- [ ] Define a test case for handling a simple HTTP GET request
- [ ] Use the testing framework to create these test cases

### 4. Implement Minimal Server Code
- [ ] Write the minimal code necessary to pass the startup test
- [ ] Write the minimal code necessary to handle the simple HTTP GET request
- [ ] Refactor code as needed to keep it clean and maintainable

### 5. Enhance and Refactor Tests
- [ ] Refine existing tests to include edge cases and various scenarios
- [ ] Add test cases for handling different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Implement tests for handling query parameters and request headers

### 6. Implement Server Features
- [ ] Expand server code to fulfill the requirements outlined in the tests
- [ ] Implement handling of static files and serving their content
- [ ] Refactor code and follow TDD principles: red, green, refactor

### 7. Implement Error Handling
- [ ] Write tests to cover scenarios like invalid requests and server errors
- [ ] Implement error handling mechanisms in the server code
- [ ] Ensure that error responses are generated and sent correctly

### 8. Implement Advanced Features
- [ ] Write tests for more complex features like HTTPS support or RESTful APIs
- [ ] Implement these features while adhering to TDD practices
- [ ] Continuously refactor code to maintain test coverage and readability

### 9. Test the Entire System
- [ ] Create integration tests to verify the interaction of server components
- [ ] Run tests against the entire system to ensure its proper functioning
- [ ] Automate test execution in your build process

### 10. Documentation and Readme
- [ ] Write a detailed README.md explaining your project's TDD approach
- [ ] Provide instructions for building, testing, and running the web server
- [ ] Include code snippets and explanations for key components and tests

### 11. Code Review and Optimization
- [ ] Review your code for adherence to coding standards and best practices
- [ ] Optimize critical sections of your code for performance, if necessary
- [ ] Consider peer reviews to gather feedback on your implementation

## Conclusion
Creating a C++ web server using Boost Beast with a Test-Driven Development approach ensures that your server is both functional and robust. This methodology promotes well-tested and maintainable code, fostering confidence in the server's behavior and enabling iterative development.
